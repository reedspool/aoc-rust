# Advent of Code in Rust


## Install

You'll need cargo, rust's package manager.

`cargo build`

## Run

All the code works by cargo's testing framework

Run `cargo test` and if all the tests pass, everything is working.

See the test code in the `challenge_<day>.rs` files under their `aoc_<year>` directories.

You can also run `cargo watch -c -x "test"` to run the tests in watch mode as you make changes.

And `cargo watch -c -x "test 2019"` for example to filter only tests from year 2019.
